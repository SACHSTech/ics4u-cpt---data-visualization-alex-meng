Check the [VS Code, Java, and JavaFX Install and Set Up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s5oTmY8A8TDZu303p_DaH6CEAcC9xL8-aNX-pAxCcps/edit?usp=sharing) doc for set up and getting started instructions.

## Data set:
* Population of different countries in different years
* Includes entries on each continent and the world
* Entries for countries start at year 1800
* Entries for continents and the world start in year -10,000(10000 BCE)
* 46883 Entries total (Top line is column header)

### Format:

## Why This Data Set:
I selected this data set because I felt it was just right for this project. The data wasn't anything too complex, but it wasn't too simple either. I also find population growth interesting, seeing how we started from such a small population, to one so large. Did you know, since 1999, the world population has gone up by
1.6 billion people? I found that out while testing my code. It's pretty crazy.
